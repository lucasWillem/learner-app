# Run

The easiest way to run this server is with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the provided [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) script.
Be sure to consider the [Docker post install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) should you be working on a linux machine.
Once you have Docker and Docker compose installed you can run the server with the following command.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
